**Project Structure**

The project is organized into key directories and files, including the main application file, required dependencies, static files and templates for styling, HTML templates, and the trained model files.


**Processes Involved**

1. **Data Collection**: Collected 3 different datasets from kaggle.com containing labeled emails (spam and non-spam).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:

* Text cleaning to remove unwanted characters and stop words.
* Vectorization to convert text data into numerical format using Count Vectorization.

3. **Model Training**:

* Selection of suitable machine learning algorithms.
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Training the model using the training data and validating its performance on the test set.
  
4. **Model Evaluation**:

* Evaluating the model using classification report, to get the recall, precision and f1-score.

5. **Deployment**:

* Developing the web application to handle user input.
* Integrating the trained model into the application for real-time predictions.
* Ensuring a responsive user interface for an optimal user experience.

**How to Use**

Users can open the application in their web browser, paste the email content into the provided text area, and click the prediction button to determine whether the email is classified as spam or not.

**Future Improvements**

* Implementing advanced NLP techniques such as BERT or transformers for better classification accuracy.
* Allowing users to train the model on their own datasets for customized spam detection.
